I will get the 21 sights and mark they on the map then I will trace a route to get to monument \"S\" fast and see what are the other monuments in the away that I can visit. this is a simplified version as it can be way more detailed if you start to add variables so for example if I will be driving traffic should be considered as it can get jammed and compromise the time so the better route will be different from a walking one.\n",
