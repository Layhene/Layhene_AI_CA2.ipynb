In order to better use my time will always have a better route where the path is shorter and or more favourable due to my conditions so for example I have a short amount of time to visit the city this city has 21 sightings/nodes so lets say I've two particular ones that I wan to see \"A\" and \"S\" since I've decided my priorites now I can calculate what are the other monuments closet to then so \"A\" is where a start and \"S\" is where I am going. I will get the 21 sights and mark they on the map then I will trace a route to get to monument \"S\" fast and see what are the other monuments in the away that I can visit. this is a simplified version as it can be way more detailed if you start to add variables so for example if I will be driving traffic should be considered as it can get jammed and compromise the time so the better route will be different from a walking one.\n",
